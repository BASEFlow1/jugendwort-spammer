For all readers who do not speak German: Learn German, du Hurensohn!
This script is based on a meme on the german subreddit [r/ich_iel](https://reddit.com/r/ich_iel). The people there like to call people who don't speak German a Hurensohn (son of a bitch).

Langenscheidt (a German publishing house) organizes every year the selection for the youth word of the year. The last few years these were rather words that 60 year olds thought youth would use. This year we can submit words ourselves. That's how the idea for this script was born. 

Besides Python 3 and Selenium you also need [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) available in your PATH. 

If someone wants to contribute, he could reverse-engineer the requests to surveymonkey (cookies...) so that we can submit our proposal (theoretically, of course) even more frequently.
